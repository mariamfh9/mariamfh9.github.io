I finally did it. As soon as I found out about the CLI gems project, I was very intimidated with the idea of creating a project that didn't have a set of instructions, no file to start me off, and no lesson dedicated to it. I wasn't even sure where to start. I put off any sort of research until the week the project was due itself. However, as I started to do my research, I began to understand the concepts that we learned altogether. I realized this project was a combination of all I had learned thus far in Flatiron, and in order to get a job in the future, I needed to get over my fears and just start coding. I began to code and it all made sense. I slowly started experimenting with methods some of them started to work for me.  I started to enjoy the process, and even found Ruby's formatting gems to make my program look more appealing. Now I can say that I have finally made it, finally completed my first project and I couldn't feel more accomplished about it.
