I've finally completed my Sinatra Project, and to say it feels good is an understatement. At first, this project was very confusing even though I was able to complete the assignments in this section successfully. I thought I had it almost done with on the first day of project week. However, I quickly realized that wasn't the case when I realized how careful I had to be because of the topic I chose. My project is an account for users to store their passwords. Basically, a virtual password vault. This entails that the project must be extremely careful and protective of arguably, a persons most valuable set of data: their passwords. 

This part took me about 2 days to complete and master, as I tried to break my program for hours and then come up with a fix. However, when I was able to finally make my project work, without any errors, I was overjoyed. I was finally going to stylize my webpage, something I've always loved about web design! 

Now I can say that I've finally gotten it done with, and I can't wait for this short break! Whew!
