I believe I knew how to type even before I could speak. Ever since I was a child, I knew I was going to grow up to work with computers. Everyone around me--from my own father, to relatives, cousins, family friends, to even all my classmates' parents were all in technical fields. I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley, so seeing the constant updates in  technology at my computer lab in elementary school or bringing in an Intel computer chip for show-and-tell wasn't anything surprising. I always dreaded going to school--I was never too good at the reading/comprehension subjects, but thrived when it came to math class or computer lab. For the first time, I found myself actually enjoying what I was doing at school. I would look forward to Monday's when we had computer lab first thing in the morning. Fast forward to college--I was enrolled as a computer science major and always knew I would one day be working at one of the tech companies I was so accustomed to seeing anytime I left my home. I eagerly did a few internships which included game design and building Samsung VR apps. My life then took a turn when I met the love of my life, who happened to be from the East Coast. It was settled: I was willing to move all the way to Pennsylvania. It was an adjustment, to say the least. The worst part was how difficult it was for me to find a job. I had been applying for 6-7 months with just a handfull of in person interviews, with a rejection call every time. I knew I had to do something to pursue my dream of working as a software engineer so I found out about Flatiron School. I hope this journey will help me to find the right career and build my skillset. So for now, I should get back to my program!
